# Optical Reflectance and Transmittance with Transfer-Matrix Method
Python code to calculate optical reflectance (**R**) and transmittance (**T**) of a thin film stack based on [*transfer-matrix method*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer-matrix_method_(optics)).

# Binder stopped working
The demo can no longer start (found in September 2024). Will look for another tool to serve and update the code accordingly.

# Interactive Demo
Click the binder badge below to launch an interactive demo notebook. A user can provide information of a thin film stack to get **R** / **T** heatmaps. Additional options to slice across wavelength and angle of incidence are also available.
